# MicrosoftEssexLDA

This is a project executed between LAMFO (Univesity of Brasil√≠a) and UoE (University of Essex) in a coloboration fomented by Microsoft AI for Health for analysing misinformation regarding Covid-19 on News Outlets. 

## Pattern

[Pattern for extracted data - Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hpcQpL-gr6xjvaRqL07pfX3jDJOIG9cYnHjnQPhDY2w/edit#gid=0)

Basic naming convention for columns: 'URL', 'Date', 'Source', 'Categories', 'Search Terms', 'Text', 'Author', 'Country'
There may have more columns (as index) but only this will be used as of now.

Naming convention for folders (regarding the project [MicrosoftEssexScrapers](https://github.com/lamfo-unb/MicrosoftEssexScrapers)): results/NAMEOFSOURCE

Naming convention for the file collected (please note there may be only one file per source): "articles.csv.zip" or "articles.zip" regardless of content (be it an article or not).
